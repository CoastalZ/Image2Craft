#### Every single of these come from r/place 2022

# Functionality
#### Possibilities
- You can generate datapacks
- You can make a mcfunction for each photo in a folder
- You can choose which blocks are used in a build or just use the default blocks (Concrete, Wool)
- List of usable blocks is below, included in a table
#### Limitations
- Bigger images than 500x500 can make minecraft lag a little (and take few minutes to generate in the world), 1000x1000 and more can crash the game (this is caused by the minecraft optimalization)
